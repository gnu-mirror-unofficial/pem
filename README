                                    ===========

            Hi,

                 I  am  happy to give you this *new* version of Pem. Pem
            is a handy tool to help you  keep  track  of  your  personal
            income  and  expenses.  On  Linux like systems, Pem works by
            storing the details in a CSV  file,  placed  in  the  ~/.pem
            directory  under  your $HOME directory; On Windows, the same
            file is placed in pem  directory,  under  the  %USERPROFILE%
            directory.  Each such file is named after the current month,
            and is automatically created by Pem when you enter the first
            record  for  the  month.  It  is not advisable to edit these
            files by hand.

            Installation:
            =============

            On Linux: just say
            ---------

                 $ ./configure [--prefix=/install/directory]
                 $ make
                 # make install

            By default, this should  install  Pem  under  /usr/local/bin
            directory,  assuming  you  have  the  right privileges to do
            that. You may also consider changing the  prefix  using  the
            --prefix  option,  in  case  you  don’t  have  the necessary
            permissions. For more information  please  see:  ./configure
            --help.

            On Windows:
            -----------
                Copy  and  paste  the pem.pl file to the directory where
            you keep your other executable files, and  make  sure,  this
            directory  is  included in your %PATH% variable. That’s all,
            Pem is ready to serve you. :)

            For usage information about pem, on Linux, try

                 $ pem --help
                 $ man pem
                 $ info pem

            On Windows try

                 C:\> pem.pl --help

            Also, use the pem.txt file to explore what Pem can  do,  and
            how it does that.
